## Info

Animetaverse is a theme created using the amazing pixel art made by my good friend [Gustavo Viselner](https://x.com/PixelGustavo). <br><br>
The branding resemblance to the [Animetaverse](https://www.animetaverse.club) website is not casual, as I also made that website. This is for all the fan of old school pixel art and cyberpunk-esque graphics. <br><br>
If you enjoy it and/or have any questions, feel free to drop a follow on my [<s>twitter</s> x](https://x.com/fccview)

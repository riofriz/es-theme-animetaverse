## Customizations

> The only supported view for gamelist is "Detailed" for now. "Basic" will show a "roms not found" message. I am using the basic view as a fallback for when a system does not have roms as all my effort went into the detailed view anyway.

- Choose between vertical and horizontal view
- Hide/Show the monkey on the video preview
- Select between yellow/magenta on both home screen and game list
- Choose background audio (between two full songs and 3 different loops)
- Mute/Unmute game video previews
- Select video/image background for lower performance machines

## Info

Animetaverse is a theme created using the amazing pixel art made by my good friend [Gustavo Viselner](https://x.com/PixelGustavo). <br><br>
The branding resemblance to the [Animetaverse](https://www.animetaverse.club) website is not casual, as I also made that website. This is for all the fan of old school pixel art and cyberpunk-esque graphics. <br><br>
